report back errors when calling callbacks 
---------------------------------------------------

Callbacks are invoked in the receiver-thread
and any exception will kill the whole receiver-thread. 
This is especially bad if it happens remotely as 
it leaves the other side inaccesssible. 

Control-C behaviour / best practises
-------------------------------------------

currently calling channel.receive() in the
main thread will prevent Control-C from passing.
Consider an internal timeout so that signals
get a chance to propagate.  


rsync links from posix to windows 
-----------------------------------------

tags: 1.1 
bb: http://bitbucket.org/hpk42/py-trunk/issue/35
path: execnet/rsync.py 

currently rsyncing bails out with a strange message when trying to rsync
links. should provide better message or even some support for doing it.
