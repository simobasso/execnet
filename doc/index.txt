Python_ is a mature dynamic language whose interpreters can interact with 
all major computing platforms today.  Execnet provides carefully tested 
means to ad-hoc connect to Python interpreters across version, platform 
and network barriers.  It provides a minimal, fast and robust API for 
the following uses:

* distribute tasks to multiple CPUs
* write and deploy hybrid multi-process applications 
* write scripts to interact a bunch of exec environments

.. _Python: http://www.python.org

Features
------------------

* zero-install bootstrapping: no manual remote installation!

* flexible communication: send/receive as well as 
  callback/queue mechanisms supported

* simple serialization of python builtin types (no pickling)

* grouped creation and robust termination of processes

* well tested between CPython 2.4-3.1, Jython 2.5.1 and PyPy 1.1
  interpreters.

* fully interoperable between Windows and Unix-ish systems. 

* many tested :doc:`examples`

Known uses
-------------------

* `py.test`_ uses it for its `distributed testing`_ mechanism. 

* Jacob Perkins uses it for his `Distributed NTLK with execnet`_ 
  project to launch computation processes through ssh. 

* Ronny Pfannschmidt uses it for his `anyvc`_ VCS-abstraction project
  to bridge the Python2/Python3 version gap. 

* sysadmins and developers are using it for ad-hoc custom scripting

Project status
--------------------------

The current 1.0 series aims at :doc:`basic API <basics>` stabilization, improved tracing and robust termination.

The 1.1 series will target setting up permanent networks and offering unix-shell-like capabilities to spawn processes and applications.

execnet was conceived and is `actively developed`_ by `Holger Krekel`_.
