Python_ is a mature dynamic language whose interpreters can interact with 
all major computing platforms today.  

**execnet** provides carefully tested means to ad-hoc interact with Python
interpreters across version, platform and network barriers.  It provides
a minimal and fast API targetting the following uses:

* distribute tasks to local or remote CPUs 
* write and deploy hybrid multi-process applications 
* write scripts to administer a bunch of exec environments

.. _Python: http://www.python.org

Features
------------------

* automatic bootstrapping: no manual remote installation.

* safe and simple serialization of python builtin types (no pickle)

* flexible communication: synchronous send/receive as well as 
  callback/queue mechanisms supported

* easy creation, handling and termination of multiple processes

* well tested interactions between CPython 2.4-3.1, Jython 2.5.1 
  and PyPy 1.1 interpreters.

* fully interoperable between Windows and Unix-ish systems. 

* many tested :doc:`examples`

Known uses
-------------------

* `py.test`_ uses it for its `distributed testing`_ mechanism. 

* Jacob Perkins uses it for his `Distributed NTLK with execnet`_ 
  project to launch computation processes through ssh. 

* Ronny Pfannschmidt uses it for his `anyvc`_ VCS-abstraction project
  to bridge the Python2/Python3 version gap. 

* sysadmins and developers are using it for ad-hoc custom scripting

Project status
--------------------------

The current 1.0 series aims at :doc:`basic API <basics>` stabilization, improved tracing and robust termination.

The 1.1 series will target setting up permanent networks and offering unix-shell-like capabilities to spawn processes and applications.

execnet was conceived and is `actively developed`_ by `Holger Krekel`_.
