Welcome to execnet!
=========================

The execnet package allows to: 

* instantiate local/remote Python Interpreters
* send code for execution to one or many Interpreters 
* send and receive data through channels

execnet performs **zero-install bootstrapping** into other interpreters; 
package installation is only required at the initiating side.  execnet enables
interoperation between CPython 2.4-3.1, Jython 2.5.1, PyPy 1.1 and IronPython 
and works well on Windows, Linux and OSX systems.

execnet was written and is maintained by `Holger Krekel`_ (blog_) with contributions from many others.  The package is licensed under the GPL Version 2 or later, at your choice.  Contributions and some parts of the package are licensed under the MIT license. 

.. note::
   Support of Jython and IronPython are experimental at this point.
   Feedback and help with testing welcome.
