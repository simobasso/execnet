Creation and termination of of grouped Gateways
------------------------------------------------------

::

    >>> import execnet
    >>> group = execnet.Group()
    >>> group.makegateway("popen")
    <PopenGateway id='1' receive-live, 0 active channels>
    >>> group.makegateway("popen")
    <PopenGateway id='2' receive-live, 0 active channels>
    >>> group
    <Group [<PopenGateway id='1' receive-live, 0 active channels>, <PopenGateway id='2' receive-live, 0 active channels>]>
    >>> group.makegateway("popen")
    <PopenGateway id='3' receive-live, 0 active channels>
    >>> group
    <Group with 3 gateways>
    >>> group.terminate()

Group termination will cause all member Gateways to exit.

Working with Groups and Gateway IDs
------------------------------------------------------

All gateways are created as part of a group and receive
a per-group unique ``id`` after successful initialization.  
This identification string can be set via an ``id=...`` part 
in an gateway URL as passed to ``group.makegateway``. Example::

    >>> import execnet
    >>> group = execnet.Group()
    >>> gw = group.makegateway("popen//id=sub1")
    >>> assert gw.id == "sub1"
    >>> group['sub1']
    <PopenGateway id='sub1' receive-live, 0 active channels>
