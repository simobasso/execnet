Instantiate a socket server in a new subprocess 
-----------------------------------------------------

(experimental) The following example opens a PopenGateway, i.e. a python
child process, and starts a socket server within that process 
and then opens a second gateway to the freshly started
socketserver::
                
    import execnet 

    popengw = execnet.PopenGateway()
    socketgw = execnet.SocketGateway.new_remote(popengw, ("127.0.0.1", 0))

    print socketgw.remote_status() # print some info about the remote environment
