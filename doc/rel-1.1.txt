refactoring 
execnet-1.1 is a backward compatible beta release.  execnet provides a
share-nothing model with channel-send/receive communication for
distributing execution across many Python interpreters across version,
platform and network barriers. 

See below for more change info and here for extensive documentation
and tested examples:

Particular thanks to Ronny Pfannschmidt for a lot of internal cleanups
and to Alex Gaynor for providing feature patches.

Have fun,

1.1 (compared to 1.0.9)
--------------------------------

- introduce execnet.dumps/loads providing serialization between
  python interpreters.

- group.remote_exec now supports kwargs as well

- support per channel string coercion configuration

- Popen2IO.read now reads correct amounts of bytes from nonblocking fd's

- added a ``dont_write_bytecode`` option to Popen gateways, this sets the
  ``sys.dont_write_bytecode`` flag on the spawned process, this only works on
  CPython 2.6 and higher.  Thanks to Alex Gaynor.

- added a pytest --broken-isp option to skip tests that assume
  DNS queries for unknown hosts actually are resolved as such (Thanks
  Alex Gaynor)

- fix issue 1 - decouple string coercion of channels and gateway

- fix issue #2 - properly reconfigure the channels string coercion for rsync,
  so it can send from python2 to python3

- refactor socketserver, so it can be directly remote_exec'd for starting a socket gateway on a remote
